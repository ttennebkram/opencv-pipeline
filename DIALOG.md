# Dialog Log

This file records interactive dialog between the **user** and **Claude Code** for this project.

It is intended as a chronological, append-only audit log:
- Each entry is timestamped (with timezone).
- User input and Claude responses are clearly labeled.
- New dialog entries are appended below the “Latest Dialog” section.
- Older entries follow in chronological order.

This file may be updated automatically by local tooling.
It is not part of the public project history and may be excluded from the main branch.
