Histogram node
compare all java nodes to python effects
    /Users/mbennett/Dropbox/dev/webcam-filters
check all sliders that require odd ints
Main class doing LOTS of instanceof, I think in serialization stuff?
change package name
accuracy of mouse on connection points when zoomed way out
.fft low pass filter
    figure out radius filters and smoothness
? grid pattern doesn't change on zoom
    maybe just the dots where they intersect?
.finish impl of Harris Corners
    .still missing some
    .default color green
    /what does Draw Features mean in the python version?
/rename Shi-Tomasi to ... Corners
.    FINISH ST corners
.finish Scharr
/Laplacian shows Canny Edge properties
/   properties too narrow
.   add more UI elements
.Sobel
    .dx / dy 3 horizontal radio buttons
    Sobel Properties -> Sobel Edge Properties
.Contours
.Blobs

.dual input nodes
    .require both queues fire
    .work on either firing and last state of other
        .if both 30 fps there would be ~60 objects emitted
        .make it a UI checkbox for queues-in-sync default to NO

/need bitwise NOT
    doc: same effect as Invert, but diff math, just mention in README

/maybe not clamp values that are externally edited in JSON
    /"no external clamp"
/button bar green area slightly wider, maybe buttons need more E W padding 
/Unknown node type: Mean Shift Blur
/Unknown node type: Grayscale/Color Convert
/double click on node buttons should only give one
/rename: node title: Mean Shift Blur
/rename: node title: Node Color Convert -> Grayscale/Color Convert
/Box Blur
    /too narrow for 2 or 3 digit readout at end of slider
    /slider lets you pick even ints
    /"unknown: Box Blur"
/Inputs: -> Sources:
/recatogorize Draw: to Content:
/zoom % truncated
/rename: node: Bilateral Filter -> ... Blur
/Unknown Gradient/MorphEx
/TextNode: No "bold" checkbox
/   default color should be green
/Scharr Properties -> Scharr Edge Properties
/fix Hough Lines
/    properties are for Gaussian Blur
/    and should be Unknown if issue deserializing
/fix canny edges --> Gaussian Blur
/grid scrolling
/   magnification/zoom
/Scharr rename to Scharr Edges when node is displayed
/    same for Laplacian
/    Canny EdgeS
/    Sobel EDGES
x Sharr -> Canny edge
