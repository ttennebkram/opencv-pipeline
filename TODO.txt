.Ability to move Container Nodes Input and Output nodes around, esp when making big diagram

Sub-window container window button bar, no find fuction.
    How can this happen if we're using the same code?


Container edit window: Container: Container 1

.The special container input and output nodes are not tall enough to display their thumbnail

the resize of preview window area in the main root editor is no longer resizeable with the vertical line
    between Output Preview and the main grid area 

..Container in main root window not showing its work output counter incrementing

.In container editor with Clone output,
    .cannot click to yank an existing connection 
    .Instead of disconnecting a connection, now the connection vanishes 

Special Container Input and Output nodes have the type expected on the next line "Image", should be on the same line as "Input" or "Output"
    and then the priority and work count, doesn't have either

Add w/Clamp no In1: In2: counts, no pri and work counts

Container Editor: No mouse-over tool tips on connections

!..double click on node in subwindow, brings main window into focus

Container editor: special Input node, doesn't have In: counter

Suddenly none of the nodes in the Container editor are showing their thumbnails,
    this was working, not when loaded, and not when pipeline is running
    Thumbnails not preserved on save/restart/load
    Thumbnails not shown immediately when pipeline starts, have to click some nodes to get thumbnails to show

get rid of Single Frame button

button bar on left, buttons still in wrong order, for example Grayscale/...

how many nodes override .paint()?
    can they be refactored?

Container editor special Input and Output nodes need to be wider due to the 3 holes/dots
    Input node either not displaying In: or it's overlaid by the 3 dots
    also not tall enough for thumbnail

.buttons in container editor window not in the correct order
    buttons in toolbar still in wrong order, ex: Grayscale, in Container editor window

!.Can't select nodes by clicking and dragging in Container Editor window

.click and drag on the selected group cancels the group selection and just highlights that node.
    Need to see if it's click and DRAG before reselecting a node that was already in the selection grouip.
.Arrow keys shouuld be able to move a selected set of nodes, 1 pixel at a time regardless of zoom level

click and drag on connection point on node in Container editor moves the node instead of yanking the connection 

/Special Input and Output nodes still not wide enough

.Special Input node in Container editor has bigger thumbnail than all other nodes, including special Output node
    Input node should probably use same size as everybody else
    odd that it's just the input node
    OR MAYBE Inpuut node is correct size, and all other nodes are accidnetly a bit smaller getting resized (look a bit chunky)

.Add w/Clamp not showing In1: In2: counts, and not incrementing its Work counter
    can we check if it's not inheriting from its base classes and just doing an old outdated .paint()

.Cursor keys should move Node just 1 pixel when at 100% mode, and equiv of 1 pixel when zoomed in or out, so when zoomed out would be hard to see just 1 push of arrow key direction

.Queue stats not showing on connections inside Container Editor 


.c nodes under Basic category in button bar are all sorted alphabetically,
    but Grayscale needs to be an exception to that, it needs to be at the top b/c it's very common

.Gain Control properties too narrow, readout label moves to the next row/line

.Container Node display doesn't have In: counter 

Just clicking on the middle of a connection makes it vanish in Container editor

Container editor should also have Run Pipeline / Stop Pipeline button, green and red, etc.  Everybody should be able to stop the pipeline w/o needing to go to the main window, status will need to be reflected in all windows

.can't click and drag from container output node to yank that end of the connection

.can't click and delete connection in container editor

/connector has no arrow head

.preview window not working in container editor, even if pipeline is running

?Container edit window save dialog, can't select previously used json files like container1.json, grayed out
    file dialog box has dropdwon of *.json

.FFT high-pass classic: Properties dialog box too narrow or selector too wide to display double digit slider readout

.Container editor, double click on node, sometimes brings main root window into focus above container editor window

.since there's no status
  bar (why not?) there's no way to zoom in or out 

.Vanishing container node after edit in parent/root Window
    multiple times, but inconsistent
