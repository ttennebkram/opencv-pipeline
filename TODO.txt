compare all java nodes to python effects
    /Users/mbennett/Dropbox/dev/webcam-filters
change package name

lots of "hard coding" in the registry

? grid pattern doesn't change on zoom
    maybe just the dots where they intersect?

.fft low pass filter
    figure out radius filters and smoothness
    can we plot the curve?
.finish impl of Harris Corners
    .still missing some
    .default color green
    /what does Draw Features mean in the python version?
/rename Shi-Tomasi to ... Corners
.    FINISH ST corners
.finish Scharr
/Laplacian shows Canny Edge properties
/   properties too narrow
.   add more UI elements
.Sobel
    .dx / dy 3 horizontal radio buttons
    Sobel Properties -> Sobel Edge Properties
.Contours
.Blobs
check all sliders that require odd ints
Main class doing LOTS of instanceof, I think in serialization stuff?
check all Java Nodes against all Python Effects

.dual input nodes
    .require both queues fire
    .work on either firing and last state of other
        .if both 30 fps there would be ~60 objects emitted
        .make it a UI checkbox for queues-in-sync default to NO

/need bitwise NOT
    doc: same effect as Invert, but diff math, just mention in README

/accuracy of mouse on connection points when zoomed way out
/Histogram node
/maybe not clamp values that are externally edited in JSON
    /"no external clamp"
/button bar green area slightly wider, maybe buttons need more E W padding 
/Unknown node type: Mean Shift Blur
/Unknown node type: Grayscale/Color Convert
/double click on node buttons should only give one
/rename: node title: Mean Shift Blur
/rename: node title: Node Color Convert -> Grayscale/Color Convert
/Box Blur
    /too narrow for 2 or 3 digit readout at end of slider
    /slider lets you pick even ints
    /"unknown: Box Blur"
/Inputs: -> Sources:
/recatogorize Draw: to Content:
/zoom % truncated
/rename: node: Bilateral Filter -> ... Blur
/Unknown Gradient/MorphEx
/TextNode: No "bold" checkbox
/   default color should be green
/Scharr Properties -> Scharr Edge Properties
/fix Hough Lines
/    properties are for Gaussian Blur
/    and should be Unknown if issue deserializing
/fix canny edges --> Gaussian Blur
/grid scrolling
/   magnification/zoom
/Scharr rename to Scharr Edges when node is displayed
/    same for Laplacian
/    Canny EdgeS
/    Sobel EDGES
x Sharr -> Canny edge
