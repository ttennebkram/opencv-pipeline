New bugs after SWT -> JavaFX conversoion
----------------------------------------

Main Classes:
    PipelineEditorLauncher - The entry point configured in pom.xml (used by both exec:exec and the shaded JAR)
    PipelineEditorApp - The actual JavaFX Application class
Top 5 longest Java files:
  | Lines | File                         |

.completely remove SWT code
    /remove from POM
    /remove legacy code
    remove JavaFX "legacy" code, instanceof, case, if/then/else
        isContainer
        isSource
    ,test unified .jar

Refactor main PipelineEditor to use Container Editor even for main editor window
Boundary:
    Need IF NESTED node

.Need examples directory, with an image
    large monitor image
    fft-ringing.json

Clone node shouldn't be able to be disabled

.when I multi-highlight notes and use arrow keys to move, it moves the grid instead, not the nodes
    it shoiuld move by the equivalent of 1 pixel per keystroke when at 100%

/the little dots on the Boundary Nodes shouldn't be round, may look like connection points
    /maybe hexagonal
Boundary nodes: change titles: Input -> Container Input, Output -> Container Output

IF node with dual input
    If in Subdiagram/Subpipeline
    If NOT in Sub, then Boundary nodes grayed out

connectors should not vanish just because node there were connected to is deleted


image file paths should be resolved relative to the .json file that's referencing them

Help menu...

tip jar in About doc

if nothing matches search box, then it should display "No matches found, please change or clear your search term" in itallics where the buttons would normally appear, on the green background

.we're not showing the method signatures any more in Properties

.When doing File New, the Container windows from the previous drawing should close

File Source: while running the pipeline, you select a new image with the file source,
    it doesn't send the new image through the pipeline
    the image goes through, but is not processed by each node
    maybe just get rid of that feature if too complex


.Still see old Preview image when have created a new file

.connection points shouldn't accept connector drops or start connection gestures if they already have a connection there

.Enabled Checkmark for all nodes, upper left next to the name
    enabled/disabled checkbox, upper left
    Multi input: just take from input 1
    Multi output: just output to output 1
    Container node: have monitoring thread do the work

.In a top level save in the editor, the save needs to propogate down the contianer hierarchy to prompt them to save as 
well; save always works from the current window down, same for number of nodes, and soon to be thread counts

thread info

threshold needs to output calculated T value

?finish impl of Harris Corners
    .still missing some
    .default color green
    /what does Draw Features mean in the python version?

?finish Scharr
/Laplacian shows Canny Edge properties
/   properties too narrow
.   add more UI elements
.Contours
.Blobs
check all sliders that require odd ints
Main class doing LOTS of instanceof, I think in serialization stuff?
check all Java Nodes against all Python Effects


Longer Term:
------------

compare all java nodes to python effects
    /Users/mbennett/Dropbox/dev/webcam-filters

Optionally have the queues persist to disk
    ? handling of frames, encoded or separate file/dir

data structures: work units between nodes has frame section and "user data" section
different input/output types

custom Python node

Support copy and paste

how many nodes override .paint()?
    can they be refactored?

.Paramertize MOST hard-coded numbers damnit!
    /colors
    other?

/Container Editor status bar:
    Should show number of running threads, implication is that it's for that diagram down
    Yes, have it shown for that diagram down
    Does Container have its own thread?
        I think yes...
        that would be counted as the parent's total
            the two input/output nodes count towards child
            again, what's countable on screen
    x rule: threads are countable number of nodes on that screen, PLUS all nodes downstream in the container hierarchy
?Upper right corner icon in Container rendering in parent diagram, 
    mouse over / tool tip "Edit Container's Sub-diagram"
/add OK and Cancel buttons to PipelineEditor window
    inconsistent Cancel behavior
/File Source node still sluggish to show new name after Properties name edit
/debug log all json files that are read or saved, even for the contents of a container
/Doc: Yes, you can edit while running, we encourage doing so to see the effects of your changes in real time 
/Add help links
    offer for local install
/add to .gitignore files like .TODO.txt.swp
/In any of the FFT properties dialog boxes, add a Note: that FFT is the slowest node, can often only handle < 1 fps
/Container should be called "Container/Sub-diagram"
/Instructions section: Click AND DRAG circles to connect
    in both Pipeline Editor and Container Editor
    make sure the Instructions area is a common bit of code shared by both editors
/Button bar, swap Content and Blur
/Container editor: can't click on connection to delete it
    also can drag to highlight it either
/Boundary nodes: don't have the corresponding Out: 0, In: 0.
/Boundary nodes: the dot on the top could be just a little lower,
  and the bottom dot could be just a bit higher 
/Boundary node: Input node is shorter than all the other nodes
/Boundary nodes: Output is taller than input?  Very odd
    Input node is shorter than all the other nodes
/In Container window, connections do not show queue stats
/Whem moving parent window, child window is also moved, should stay where it is
/Don't persist the width nor height of a node in JSON file
    ignore any widths/heights read back in
/Need mouse over tool tip for help link on all nodes.
    If node has no help, then "Help (not available for this node type)".
/Also need tool tip Enabled/Disabled button, tool tip "Enable / Disable this Node" 
/Arrow tip on the end of connectors: they still aren't aligned rotationally with that end of the connector line
/FFT 4 needs tool tips over every output
    and also on its inputs
    and all connection points should have tooltips
/(->fft) Hint on File Source to maybe resize it to 640x480 with the resize node
/In the container editor window, the button bar doesn't have as much horizontal padding to show the green background 
/Pri display in nodes, needs to be darker gray or black
/Boundary nodes Input: needs to show the number of things it's read in.  Output node needs to show its stats for Out:
/Add (Clamp) -> Add w/Clamp
/File Source: properties label I think "File:"? is truncated, the dialog is not wide enough
/File Source (and probably others): the Category from the button bar doesn't need to be displayed in the properties dialog box 
/Rendering of two input nodes: use the same vertical spacing as Clone outputs for both connection drag point and In1: In2:
/Boundary nodes shouldn't have FPS
/!Double-click for most node types not bringing up full dailog
    example: clicking on Gain, no way to set the actual gain
/On save/restart/load, the Priority and Work stats are not shown
/Add note to dialog that FFT is slow
/FFT4 out1: not getting filtered image
/FFT4 out2: looks like just a passthrough
/FFT4 out3: not getting the FFT visualization
/FFT4 out4: not getting the filter curve
/FFT4 Tool Tips over the connector endpoints
    tool tips over all the connection points
/In the button bar and when displaying a node, Grayscale needs to be "Grayscale/Color Convert" 
/File source, needs FPS in properties, default to automatic, which is 1fps for static image, and normal fps for video
/Pipeline not stopped when creating a new file
/Also worried about threads from old diagram staying running when New or Open other diagram
/Pipeline Editor: Select a container's JSON file, then OK, then open Container editor, no nodes
    it might be that some JSON files saved those subdiagrams inline in themselves?
/Pipeline Editor: status bar: Pipeline Running, no thread count
/When selecting a new file in the File Source, you don't see a thumbnail of it once loaded 
/File Source: When selecting a file, the click OK, you get a beep.  It still works, but the beep makes it like something is wrong
/I see no evidence that anything is running when a pipeline is run.
    None of the nodes update their counts, and neither do the queues/connectors
/On the container properties, there is no file path to the pipeline file, and no browse button.
/Containers should have separate standalone JSON files
/Boundary nodes should also have their "other ends" displayed
    Input Boundary node should add it's In: count
    Output Boundary node should add it's Out: count
/There's no Open on the file menu 
/make the container node color the same as the boundary nodes.  Put a constant somewhere where all 3 can see it 
/File Source: no field for file path
/File Source: no browse button for file path
/File Source: Enabled should not be in the properties
/Both main Pipeline Editor and Container Editor: alphabetize within each category
/In main pipeline editor and container editor:
/Status bar: swap the position of the Node count and the zoom magnification
/help system: please bring that over from the old code
/Tool tip on help icon still too verbose, what is it doing?
    or getting tooltip for entire node?  Still too much info
/Help link tool tip of Webcam source has too much info
/Boundary Nodes have lots their 3 vertical dots just now
/Help link looks enabled for things that have no help yet, eg: Webcam Source
/Container Editor status bar: Center should have the status of the pipeline and number of threads
/ selected nodes look a bit too similar to unselected blue nodes 
/For both the PipelineEditor UI and the Container UI, put Save and Cancel buttons above the Start Pipeline button
    please see the old code for how we did this, bindings, etc
/Just like you have it in Container Editor, the status bar
    in the main Pipeline Editoir also needs to move to the bottom of the canvas
/Button bar: CLAHE needs to say "CLAHE Contrast"
/Node display: CLAHE needs to say "CLAHE Contrast"
/Help links don't look disabled (grayed out) for items we have no help for
/Mouse over is incorrectly over the entire node
    Only the enabled checkbox and the help link should have it
/Help system, viewing doc page, argument types rendered as hyperlinks, but don't do anything when you click them
/For highlighting, use the brightest blue 0,255,0, and when highlighting a node, make its box line a little more wide
  (this is already done, it just needs to be even wider)  And for the links, when they're highlighted, draw the line a
  little heavier 
/when displaying one of the edge nodes as a node, the title across the top should intially say Canny Edges,
    not just Canny.  Same for the other 3 edges 
/connections hard to hit exactly, need "close enough" logic
/boudnary node placement and color
/When launching a Container window, give it the same size as the parent window, with just a x=40 y=40 offset
/Contaier editor: No special Bounday Input and Output nodes
/I'm getting a weird little vertical rounded square show up under my mouse.  I don't knkow what it is.  Maybe the ends of
  a scroll bar with no space in between?  Not sure.  Shows up sporadically under my mouse 
/Connectors: Queue stats not horizontally centered
/Restart doesn't bring application back up
/Container editor: search box doesn't have the "x"
/The status bar needs to be at the bottom of the canvas and take up just that horizontal space
    current layout puts zoom under preview, which gives false impression
/Enabled check boxes: Background should be white (currently dark green)
    and make checkmarks black, not white
/Container editor: menu buttons look "flat", not like they do in main PipelineEditor window
/Container editor: no "x" in the searh box
/Container editor: no Start Pipeline / Stop Pipeline above the Preview window
/Container editor: no Instructions above the preview area
/No queue stats on the connectors, please see old code
/Zoom placement is odd, looks like it wo8uld appy to the preview window.
    Can't it go on the status bar?
/Enabled checkmark should have a white background, more visibility
/Status bar: Pipeline status should be in the middle of the status bar, more visible
/Top right: missing "Instructions:"
/Move Start/Stop pipeline to upper right, above Preview pane
    please look at old code
/Webcam: still says just "Webcam", not "Webcam Soure"
/Find box doesn't have an X on the right to clear the search
/When new node is selected, it sometimes gets placed off screen, you have to know to scroll to it
/the "x" button for search box should be inside the the text box to the right,
    and if it can't, then at least touching the search box and be the same size
/File / Restart doesn't bring the application back up
/I'd like to see some progress on the Container editing window
/mouse click and drag in canvas of Container Editor still drags canvas instead of starting a select 
/Restart: NO Use mvn exec:exec for reliable JavaFX restart
    that won't work for java -jar ...
    how did the old code do it?
/PipelineEditor: replace the x with unicode multiplication sign
/Container Editor: remove the circle around the X (multiplication sign)
/PipelineEditor: make the "x" (unicode multiply) go away when text box is empty
x.Main menu still says Java, not OpenCV
    in the app bundle's Info.plist
/! File / Restart still doesn't bring application back up
    how did we do it in the main branch version? that worked perfectly
x.Main menu still says Java, not OpenCV
    in the app bundle's Info.plist
/Still no restart
/STILL: Node: Webcam -> Webcam Source
/Webcan Source Node: still way too wide
/Main menu: under Java/OpenCV
    x Quit OpenCV (instead of long class name)
    /Restart, like we had before
/Webcam source WAY too wide
/Grid: sometimes when you try to click and drag a node, it instead moves the entire grid
    this happens even when clicking on a connection point
/No arrow head on connectors
/No Tool Tips
/Node: Webcam -> Webcam Source
/Enabled check boxes don't uncheck when clicked
/Node: No In: counter
/Node: Put actual Out: (or Out1: Out2:) type of counters on the right of nodes
    this replaces the "Work: N" on top
/Left Button Bar: remove all vertical spacing
/Button bar: "Source" -> "Sources"
x!.Menu: rename Java -> OpenCV
/When first hooking a node to a new node, it'd be nice if a frame was sent through. The old system had this feature.
/Container should be rendered with a double line
/thumbnails not persisted on save/restart/load
x Quit in menu still has full class name
/On Container: Right click only offers Delete
    guessing other nodes are missing right click options too
/On Container: double click brings up Properties dialog, not the subdiagram
/Button bar: background outside of buttons should be green, not white
x Java menu, remove 2 Hide... options and show all
x Java menu, still showing full com.ttennebkram...
/Remove VERTICAL padding between buttons in the button bar
/Click and drag on empty part of the grid tries to drag the grid
/Connecting line arrow head: wrong angle in relation to that end of the line
    line is at 45 degrees, but arrowhead is horizontal, looks broken
/webcam source STILL way too wide
/buttons in left tray still need horizontal spacing, actually a fair amount so the green background is visible
/Connector: Select to Highlight, press backspace, nothing happens
/Gray for In:/Out: is too light
/On most nodes: thumbnail overwrites Out: label
/arrow head too small, and at odd angle compared to the line its connecting
    doesn't look like the same arrow
/each node can have its own custom name
/Have Container window open.  Now switch to main window, Container window doesn't acknowledge now-running pipeline, still 
shows "Start Pipeline" button (should be "Stop Pipeline", and status bar shows Pipeline Stopped 
/Container node display in parent diagram, not resetting Work to 0 when restarting pipeline
    Main PipelineEditor window: display of Container node: when starting pipeline, Container's In: counter doesn't reset to 0
/Main window status bar: only 2 threads? I have 11 total nodes
/Container window status bar: doens't show status of pipeline, no "Pipeline Running ..."
/get rid of Single Frame button
x c nodes under Basic category in button bar are all sorted alphabetically,
    but Grayscale needs to be an exception to that, it needs to be at the top b/c it's very common
/Container Node display doesn't have In: counter , just In:0
/can't click and delete connection in container editor
/FFT high-pass classic: Properties dialog box too narrow or selector too wide to display double digit slider readout
/Vanishing container node after edit in parent/root Window
    multiple times, but inconsistent
/Container Editor: Inconsistent highlight color of highlighted link
    If click on fully connected connection it turns cyan (which is fine)
    clicking on dangling mode highlights in dark blue (not consistent)
/Highlight color: selected Node outline vs selected connectors
    make the highlight color of the connection the same color blue as the highlight around a selected node
    check for connected nodes vs danglers vs free/orphan connections
/Container Editor: disconnect tail end of arrow that ran between other node output and INput 2 of Addw/Clamp, when you yank the head of the arrow from In1 and try to connect it to In2, it snaps back to in1
/since there's no status
  bar (why not?) there's no way to zoom in or out 
/Container editor, double click on node, sometimes brings main root window into focus above container editor window
/Dual input node, disconnecting from the out plug of node that leads to input 2, dangling connection arrow end jumps back to input 1
    dropping on input2 hops to in1
/container editor, can't click input of node and drag to output of other node
    it should be smart and just reverse the arrow
/?Container edit window save dialog, can't select previously used json files like container1.json, grayed out
    file dialog box has dropdwon of *.json
    yes, they are just grayed out
x?.buttons in container editor window not in the correct order
    buttons in toolbar still in wrong order, ex: Grayscale, in Container editor window
/preview window not working in container editor, even if pipeline is running
/can't click and drag from container output node to yank that end of the connection
/Just clicking on the middle of a connection makes it vanish in Container editor
/Problems with click to unhook to special output node; see the blue line, but
    when I let go it jumps back to the connection point.
/On the other end from the output of Grayscale, clicking on that connection point does nothing,
    as if I never clicked. 
/In container editor with Clone output,
    /cannot click to yank an existing connection 
    /Instead of disconnecting a connection, now the connection vanishes 
/Sub-window container window button bar, no find fuction.
    How can this happen if we're using the same code?
/Special Container Input and Output nodes have the type expected on the next line "Image", should be on the same line as "Input" or "Output"
    and then the priority and work count, doesn't have either
/Container edit window: Container: Container 1
/Ability to move Container Nodes Input and Output nodes around, esp when making big diagram
/The special container input and output nodes are not tall enough to display their thumbnail
/the resize of preview window area in the main root editor is no longer resizeable with the vertical line
    between Output Preview and the main grid area 
/..Container in main root window not showing its work output counter incrementing
/Add w/Clamp no In1: In2: counts, no pri and work counts
/!..double click on node in subwindow, brings main window into focus
/Container Editor: No mouse-over tool tips on connections
/Container editor: special Input node, doesn't have In: counter
/Suddenly none of the nodes in the Container editor are showing their thumbnails,
    this was working, not when loaded, and not when pipeline is running
    Thumbnails not preserved on save/restart/load
    Thumbnails not shown immediately when pipeline starts, have to click some nodes to get thumbnails to show
/Container editor should also have Run Pipeline / Stop Pipeline button, green and red, etc.  Everybody should be able to stop the pipeline w/o needing to go to the main window, status will need to be reflected in all windows
/Gain Control properties too narrow, readout label moves to the next row/line
/Container: priority low-priority back pressure not working
/zoom in needs to stay at the center of what you were looking at
    same for zoom out
/Container editor special Input and Output nodes need to be wider due to the 3 holes/dots
    Input node either not displaying In: or it's overlaid by the 3 dots
    also not tall enough for thumbnail
/What happens when Container diagram is changed, but main diagram is not dirty, does it pause to let you save the Container?
/!Can't select nodes by clicking and dragging in Container Editor window
/connector has no arrow head
/click and drag on the selected group cancels the group selection and just highlights that node.
    Need to see if it's click and DRAG before reselecting a node that was already in the selection grouip.
/Arrow keys shouuld be able to move a selected set of nodes, 1 pixel at a time regardless of zoom level
/click and drag on connection point on node in Container editor moves the node instead of yanking the connection 
/Special Input and Output nodes still not wide enough
/Special Input node in Container editor has bigger thumbnail than all other nodes, including special Output node
    Input node should probably use same size as everybody else
    odd that it's just the input node
    OR MAYBE Inpuut node is correct size, and all other nodes are accidnetly a bit smaller getting resized (look a bit chunky)
/Add w/Clamp not showing In1: In2: counts, and not incrementing its Work counter
    can we check if it's not inheriting from its base classes and just doing an old outdated .paint()
/When I click the upper left red x in a mac window, the windows all close, but I think if the pipeline is running therre's still threads in the
  background.  CAn you intercept the window close even, before exitign the app, to cleanly shut down the threads? 
/When a node's output queue is falling behind, and it's already lowered its priority to 1, let's have it send a "slow down" signal to the node behind it 
/Double click should bring up Container editor; right click to get Properties
/   /right click should also have Edit Container Contents
/Cursor keys should move Node just 1 pixel when at 100% mode, and equiv of 1 pixel when zoomed in or out,
/   so when zoomed out would be hard to see just 1 push of arrow key direction
/Queue stats not showing on connections inside Container Editor 
/When the q's backlog hits 5 or above the background color should shift from blue to dark red 
/c arrow heads need to be bigger
/Container Node Properties Name in the root diagram doesn't retain value on OK (at least not displayed) and doesn't set the dirty bit for name change
/Container with clone node, can't click and drag from bottom node
/Clone (2) -> Clone (2 outputs)
/?grid lines shrink/expand with zoom level
/Left toolbar/button bar still not the same size, can't we just render the button box how we do in the main window.
/Container editor lost the Bezier curve connections. 
/lots of "hard coding" in the registry
/?grid pattern doesn't change on zoom
    maybe just the dots where they intersect?
/change package name
/fft filter first have 2 outputs
    /also clone node
/restaring pipeline doesn't clear previous queue count stats
/Node Properties dialog:
