Sub-window container window button bar, no find fuction.
    How can this happen if we're using the same code?

.In container editor with Clone output,
    .cannot click to yank an existing connection 
    .Instead of disconnecting a connection, now the connection vanishes 

Optionally have the queues persist to disk
    ? handling of frames, encoded or separate file/dir

Problems with click to unhook to special output node; see the blue line, but
    when I let go it jumps back to the connection point.
On the other end from the output of Grayscale, clicking on that connection point does nothing,
    as if I never clicked. 

work units between nodes has frame and "user data"

different input/output types

custom Python node

get rid of Single Frame button

how many nodes override .paint()?
    can they be refactored?

.c nodes under Basic category in button bar are all sorted alphabetically,
    but Grayscale needs to be an exception to that, it needs to be at the top b/c it's very common

Container node display in parent diagram, not resetting Work to 0 when restarting pipeline

.Container Node display doesn't have In: counter 

.Just clicking on the middle of a connection makes it vanish in Container editor

.can't click and drag from container output node to yank that end of the connection

.can't click and delete connection in container editor

.preview window not working in container editor, even if pipeline is running

?.buttons in container editor window not in the correct order
    buttons in toolbar still in wrong order, ex: Grayscale, in Container editor window
?Container edit window save dialog, can't select previously used json files like container1.json, grayed out
    file dialog box has dropdwon of *.json

.FFT high-pass classic: Properties dialog box too narrow or selector too wide to display double digit slider readout

.Container editor, double click on node, sometimes brings main root window into focus above container editor window

.since there's no status
  bar (why not?) there's no way to zoom in or out 

.Vanishing container node after edit in parent/root Window
    multiple times, but inconsistent

/Special Container Input and Output nodes have the type expected on the next line "Image", should be on the same line as "Input" or "Output"
    and then the priority and work count, doesn't have either
/Container edit window: Container: Container 1
/Ability to move Container Nodes Input and Output nodes around, esp when making big diagram
/The special container input and output nodes are not tall enough to display their thumbnail
/the resize of preview window area in the main root editor is no longer resizeable with the vertical line
    between Output Preview and the main grid area 
/..Container in main root window not showing its work output counter incrementing
/Add w/Clamp no In1: In2: counts, no pri and work counts
/!..double click on node in subwindow, brings main window into focus
/Container Editor: No mouse-over tool tips on connections
/Container editor: special Input node, doesn't have In: counter
/Suddenly none of the nodes in the Container editor are showing their thumbnails,
    this was working, not when loaded, and not when pipeline is running
    Thumbnails not preserved on save/restart/load
    Thumbnails not shown immediately when pipeline starts, have to click some nodes to get thumbnails to show
/Container editor should also have Run Pipeline / Stop Pipeline button, green and red, etc.  Everybody should be able to stop the pipeline w/o needing to go to the main window, status will need to be reflected in all windows
/Gain Control properties too narrow, readout label moves to the next row/line
/Container: priority low-priority back pressure not working
/zoom in needs to stay at the center of what you were looking at
    same for zoom out
/Container editor special Input and Output nodes need to be wider due to the 3 holes/dots
    Input node either not displaying In: or it's overlaid by the 3 dots
    also not tall enough for thumbnail
/What happens when Container diagram is changed, but main diagram is not dirty, does it pause to let you save the Container?
/!Can't select nodes by clicking and dragging in Container Editor window
/connector has no arrow head
/click and drag on the selected group cancels the group selection and just highlights that node.
    Need to see if it's click and DRAG before reselecting a node that was already in the selection grouip.
/Arrow keys shouuld be able to move a selected set of nodes, 1 pixel at a time regardless of zoom level
/click and drag on connection point on node in Container editor moves the node instead of yanking the connection 
/Special Input and Output nodes still not wide enough
/Special Input node in Container editor has bigger thumbnail than all other nodes, including special Output node
    Input node should probably use same size as everybody else
    odd that it's just the input node
    OR MAYBE Inpuut node is correct size, and all other nodes are accidnetly a bit smaller getting resized (look a bit chunky)
/Add w/Clamp not showing In1: In2: counts, and not incrementing its Work counter
    can we check if it's not inheriting from its base classes and just doing an old outdated .paint()
/When I click the upper left red x in a mac window, the windows all close, but I think if the pipeline is running therre's still threads in the
  background.  CAn you intercept the window close even, before exitign the app, to cleanly shut down the threads? 
/When a node's output queue is falling behind, and it's already lowered its priority to 1, let's have it send a "slow down" signal to the node behind it 
/Double click should bring up Container editor; right click to get Properties
/   /right click should also have Edit Container Contents
/Cursor keys should move Node just 1 pixel when at 100% mode, and equiv of 1 pixel when zoomed in or out,
/   so when zoomed out would be hard to see just 1 push of arrow key direction
/Queue stats not showing on connections inside Container Editor 
/When the q's backlog hits 5 or above the background color should shift from blue to dark red 
/c arrow heads need to be bigger
/Container Node Properties Name in the root diagram doesn't retain value on OK (at least not displayed) and doesn't set the dirty bit for name change
/Container with clone node, can't click and drag from bottom node
/Clone (2) -> Clone (2 outputs)
/?grid lines shrink/expand with zoom level
/Left toolbar/button bar still not the same size, can't we just render the button box how we do in the main window.
/Container editor lost the Bezier curve connections. 
/lots of "hard coding" in the registry
/?grid pattern doesn't change on zoom
    maybe just the dots where they intersect?
/change package name
/fft filter first have 2 outputs
    /also clone node
/restaring pipeline doesn't clear previous queue count stats
/Node Properties dialog:
    /Enter to click the OK button to save and close and save
    /Esc to cancel and close the dialog and not save
    /If only 1 OK button, than Esc clicks OK
/need bitwise NOT
    doc: same effect as Invert, but diff math, just mention in README
/accuracy of mouse on connection points when zoomed way out
/Histogram node
/maybe not clamp values that are externally edited in JSON
    /"no external clamp"
/button bar green area slightly wider, maybe buttons need more E W padding 
/Unknown node type: Mean Shift Blur
/Unknown node type: Grayscale/Color Convert
/double click on node buttons should only give one
